## Learnings

- The most impotant aspect learned while working on this assignment was how to create responsive pages.  
It turns out that managing the different design aspect in a responsive manner can be quite time consuming and needs a bit effort to achieve desired outcome in targeted screen sizes. <br/>

- One more learning was to design the min screen size first and build up on the other screen sizes afterwards that eases the effort a bit.
- How to use the grid system effectively was also mastered while working on this assignment.
